# visitor-builder-patterns

## Project Summary
This repo implements both visitor and builder patterns for comp 373


## How to run

To run this project, please use Eclipse and add the project to a new workspace. Please add Java SE 11 and JUnit 4 to your Java Build Path and configure the Java Compiler to match to ensure that everything runs properly.

To run either pattern, please right click on the pattern you would like to run, and then select "Run as Java Application"

For any questions, please reach out to the project's collaborators. 


## Tests
All testing was done using JUnit 4. The tests are separated by pattern, meaning that both the builder and visitor patterns have their own tests in their respective locations under similar file names, TestAll.java. 

To run TestAll.java for either pattern, please right click on TestAll as select "Run As..." and then select "JUnit Test".

If you have any questions about running any of the tests, please reach out to the project's collaborators.
